FONTLOG for the Scada fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Scada Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Scada fonts and any
derivative works.

Basic Font Information

In 2005, Scada was designed as the corporate identity font for the Latvian design studio Scada.lv. In 2011 the design studio decided to make Scada a libre font. Over 6 months the font was reworked, improved and expanded into a family. It has a modern style, specifically designed for small sizes.

Scada is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Central 
Europe, Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, Baltic, 
Cyrillic, Central Europe

There are two source files:

1. sources/Scada Italic.glyphs
2. sources/Scada.glyphs
